**What I learned**
Today I researched the differences between building a Meta Quest game in **Unity** vs **Unreal Engine**.  
Both can create VR and MR apps for Quest 2/3/Pro, but they work in very different ways. Here are the most important things I discovered.

**Unity**
- Uses C# (easier for beginners, faster iteration)
- Lighter engine → better performance on mobile hardware like the Quest
- Meta XR SDK + Passthrough + Hand Tracking are simple to set up
- Very large VR community, tutorials, support
- Great if you want to prototype quickly and learn the basics fast

**Unreal Engine**
- Uses C++ and Blueprints (visual scripting)
- Much better visual quality out-of-the-box (lighting, materials, post-processing)
- More powerful for cinematic or high-end experiences
- Heavier engine → requires more optimization for Quest
- Great for pushing graphics or doing advanced VFX

**Quick summary**
- Unity = faster to learn, better performance, easier XR setup  
- Unreal = more realistic visuals, more advanced tools, heavier learning curve  

For my first Meta Quest project, **Unity is the smarter choice** because I want quick results and a simple workflow. Later I can explore Unreal for more visual-heavy experiences.

**Concept**
- infinite shooter with low poly models
- flying and walking enemies
- crates hanging from the ceiling dropping better weapons when broken
- waves getting harder

**Next**
- Find the right youtube videos
- Setup unity project
