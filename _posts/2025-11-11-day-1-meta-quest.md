**What I did**
- Researched what apps/tools/code i need to be able to develop an app for the meta quest. 
- Watched youtube videos about people who already built stuff for the meta quest.
- Found a youtube series of someone building a mixed reality game, watched the first episode and might follow it along to create my own project.
